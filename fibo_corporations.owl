        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines a set of general purpose relations for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include a number of properties required for reuse across the foundations and business entities models.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines abstract concepts for representation documents for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines abstract concepts for representation of classification schemes that themselves are intended to permit the classification of arbitrary concepts into hierarchies (or partial orders) for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines abstract concepts for representation of identifiers, identification schemes, indices and indexing schemes for use in other FIBO ontology elements.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines abstract structural concepts, including arrangement and collection, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These abstract concepts are further refined to support definition of identifiers, codes, quantities, and schemata that organize and classify such identifiers and codes.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines concepts for agreements, for use in other ontology elements. Agreements as defined here are the actual agreements between parties, and this ontology is intended to be referred to in conjunction with the contracts ontology which defines the actual contracts which formalize such agreements. The concepts of agreement and contract are intended to be kept distinct in the FIBO ontologies, that is neither is intended to be regarded as a sub type of the other.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines concepts for people and human related terms, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. People as defined here are human persons only. This ontology sets out a number of basic properties which are held by people or are definitive of a small number of specific types of people such as minors or adults. Primary use cases for determining the set of personal information definitions included are the common elements required to (1) open a bank account, (2) identify a sophisticated investor, and (3) establish foreign account ownership for money laundering purposes.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to contracts, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include written contracts which are the concrete evidence of agreements between parties, along with verbal contracts. Contracts are further broken down into bilateral and transferable contracts, the latter being the basis for most financial instruments. Properties of contracts are also defined, in particular contractual terms and contract parties. These concepts all form the basis of concepts in the financial services industry, for example interest payment terms are a kind of contract terms set, and security holders are a kind of contract counterparty.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines currency and monetary amount related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency. These are dimensionally the same but whereas &apos;money amount&apos; is defined as an amount of money, &apos;monetary amount&apos; is an abstract monetary measure.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217. ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support. The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines equity-related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. These are based on basic accounting principles as they relate to equity, debt, assets and liabilities of a firm. Equity forms the basis for ownership of certain forms of corporate body.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines formal business organizations and related concepts. The ontology covers parts of organizations, membership, classification, address relations and other properties which are applicable to formal business organizations generally. The concept of a formal business organization forms the basis for articulation of types of organization, both incorporated and non-incorporated, in other FIBO-BE ontologies.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines high level concepts relating to jurisdictions for use in other FIBO ontology elements. This includes a general definition of jurisdiction along with some basic types of jurisdiction, along with the factors which distinguish one type of jurisdiction from another. This ontology also defines basic types of legal system, and extends the basic concept of law which is in the LegalCore ontology..</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level concepts for organizations and related terms, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. It is purposefully underspecified to facilitate mapping to specific organization ontologies, such as the emerging W3C organization ontology, organization from a BMM or BPMN perspective, organization from a records management (RMS) perspective, and so forth.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level legal concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include law and constitution, both of which are framed at a more abstract level than national or state laws and constitutions, so that law forms the basis both for statutes and for company by-laws, and constitution forms the basis both for national or state constitutions and for instruments which are constitutive of incorporated legal entities. This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Other types of law are provided in the Jurisdictions ontology as extensions of concepts in this ontology. Court of Law is also defined here.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level legal concepts, especially those related to legal responsibilities, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. The ontology defines things which are conferred upon some entity by some legal instrument, and elaborates this into a number of specific capacities, responsibilities and powers, each of which forms the basis for many of the concepts used elsewhere in FIBO in defining legal personhood, executive powers and the like.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level, ownership-related concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These include the concept of owner, asset and ownership along with relationships between them whereby an asset is some thing owned by some owner.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines legal personhood concepts. A legal person as defined here is any natural person or organization which is capable of accruing liability on its own part.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines some high-level concepts of roles for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include the basic property whereby something has some role, along with the high-level concept of an agent in a role. The agent in role concept provides the basis for party in role concepts in the PartyRoles ontology and is framed as some entity defined specifically in respect to some role which it performs in some context..</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines the basic mechanisms that establish legal personhood for judicial or artificial persons, specifically those that are corporate bodies, including bodies incorporated by equity, by guarantee, and by agreement.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of an objective, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. Objectives are defined as being distinct from goals, in that they constitute time limited and measurable targets which some entity may seek to attain in pursuit of its goals.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of autonomous agent for use in other FIBO ontology elements. As defined here, autonomous agent corresponds to what is often referred to as &quot;agent&quot; in software and other systems. It is defined as any entity which is able to act on its own part, and embraces all such things, including people, animals, software agents organizations and all forms of legal persons, although not all of these concepts are elaborated in FIBO as not all are relevant to financial services.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for companies incorporated by the issuance of shares. Terms defined in this ontology are those which are applicable to all such entities. Many of these concepts form the basis of the relationships of ownership and control which obtain between entities of this type.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines the high level concept of formal organization for use in other FIBO ontology elements. It is purposefully underspecified to facilitate mapping to other formal organization ontologies, such as the emerging W3C formal organization ontology, or others defined for specific business and financial services standards. The concepts in this ontology extend those in the Organizations ontology.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology defines the high-level concepts of parties in roles, for use in other FIBO ontology elements. The concept of a party in a role describes some entity defined specifically in terms of some role which it performs in some formal contractual or transactional relationship. The ontology includes one or more basic party in role concepts. The ontology also includes one or more logical combinations of types of autonomous entity which may perform some of the party roles defined elsewhere in this ontology, such as the role of ownership.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology extends definitions of date and schedule concepts from the FinancialDates ontology with concepts defining dates that may be adjusted when they fall on weekends or holidays as defined in a given business center, for use in other FIBO ontologies.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology extends definitions of date and schedule concepts from the FinancialDates ontology with concepts defining occurrences (i.e., event-related concepts) for use in other FIBO ontologies.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology provides a very high level definition of geographic region and geopolitical entity related concepts, including, but not limited to, countries, sub-country regions such as states and provinces, municipalities, etc., extending the Object Management Group (OMG)&apos;s Languages, Countries, and Codes (LCC) ontologies as needed in FIBO. As such, these terms are automatically mapped to the LCC controlled vocabulary representing ISO 3166 country and country subdivision codes, and may be mapped to other de facto standards such as Geonames and the CIA World Factbook. The concept of a business center, defined herein, maps directly to the FpML concept with the same name, and to the set of business centers and broader municipalities included in ISO 10383, Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC).</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology provides an initial set of concepts supporting the representation of quantities, units, systems of quantities, and systems of units for use in FIBO. It is compatible with and can be mapped directly to the OMG Date Time Vocabulary (DTV) Quantities Ontology, but has been integrated into FND to provide local coverage of quantities and measurements and eliminate the SBVR mark-up.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology provides definitions of date and schedule concepts for use in other FIBO ontologies.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology provides high level definitions for addresses and address components including elements that are common to addressing standards.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This ontology provides mathematical abstractions for use in other ontologies, including for example the basic components of formulae, parameters and values.</dct:abstract>
        <dct:abstract>This vocabulary provides a set of metadata annotations for use in describing FIBO ontology elements. The annotations extend properties defined in the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata Recommendation, in the Dublin Core Metadata Terms Vocabulary and in the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Vocabulary, and have been customized to suit the FIBO specification development process. 

Note that any of the original properties provided in Dublin Core and SKOS can be used in addition to the terms provided herein. However, any Dublin Core terms that are not explicitly defined as OWL annotation properties in this ontology or in any of its imports must be so declared in the ontologies that use them.</dct:abstract>

        <sm:fileAbstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The purpose of the Country Representation ontology, based on ISO 3166 and other representations of geographic regions and countries, such as the ISO Online Browsing Platform, UN M49 Region codes, SWIFT registry, UN FAO and CIA World Factbook, FIPA and International Olympics codes for countries, and GeoNames, is to provide a systematic description of the vocabulary used for country and geopolitical entity representation (based strictly on requirements for business applications, not broader geographic or political uses). A few additional properties to support geophysical coordinates, identified in the UN FAO and CIA World Factbook as well as from the well-known GeoNames ontology, have been added, but extensions to support other coding systems, such as the FAOSTAT code, have not been included.

ISO 3166 provides widely, though not universally, applicable coded representations of names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of particular geopolitical interest and their subdivisions.
 - ISO 3166-1 (Country codes) establishes codes that represent the current names of countries, dependencies, and other areas of particular geopolitical interest, on the basis of lists of country names obtained from the United Nations.
 - ISO 3166-2 (Country subdivision code) establishes a code that represents the names of the principal administrative divisions, or similar areas, of the countries, etc. included in the ISO 3166-1.
 - ISO 3166-3 (Code for formerly used names of countries) establishes a code that represents non-current country names, i.e., the country names deleted from ISO 3166 since its first publication in 1974.
 
The United Nations Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49), described at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/, provides further regional classification for countries by continent, region within a continent, and sub-regions within regions that are widely used as well, and so this ontology is designed to support the M49 code set as well.  M49 reuses the ISO 3166 codes for countries and some regions, and augments that with additional, broader regional codes.

This ontology provides a reference model to support the first two parts of ISO 3166, along with the other coding systems mentioned above.</sm:fileAbstract>
        <sm:fileAbstract rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This ontology, based on ISO 639 as well as the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), provides a systemic description of the vocabulary used for language representation, including natural and artificial languages. 

ISO 639 provides two language codes, one as a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and another as a three-letter code (ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3, ISO 639-5) for the representation of names of languages.  ISO 639-1 was devised primarily for use in terminology, lexicography, and linguistics.  ISO 639-2 represents all of the languages contained in ISO 639-1, additional languages and language groups, as they may be coded for special purposes when more specificity in coding is needed.  The languages listed in ISO 639-1 are a subset of the languages listed in ISO 639-2; every language code element in the two-letter code has a corresponding language code element in the three-letter code, but not necessarily vice versa.  ISO 639-4 provides the basis for describing languages, as defined in this ontology, and additional codes are provided in 639-5 and other parts of the standard, again with more details about macrolanguages, other lesser known independent languages, and special language groups.

ISO 639-3 extends the set of three-letter codes provided in 639-2 to cover all of the natural, human languages in use today, along with many well-known ancient, extinct, and historical languages, including written and signed languages.  It also identifies the codes found in 639-2 that represent families or groups of languages rather than a single human language, depending on the perspective of the consumer.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-1 is the International Information Centre for Terminology, ISO 639-1/RA.  This organization is responsible for maintenance of Part-1, and more information can be found at http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php, although the actual code set is maintained by the US Library of Congress, together with the code set for ISO 639-2.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-2 is the Library of Congress, ISO 639-2/RA.  The Library of Congress is responsible for maintenance of Part-2, at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/iso639-2ra.html.  Current code sets for ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 are available from this site, as mentioned above.  In addition to the material covered in the basic standard, the Library of Congress also publishes the German names for all languages, which is reflected in the properties given below.  See http://loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php for the latest release.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-3 is SIL International, ISO 639-3/RA.  SIL International is responsible for maintenance of Part-3, and more information can be found at http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp.

The codes included herein also correspond to the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), and can be used for matching or other application development purposes (e.g., use of language identifier literals in applications that build up the RFC 4646 based tags).

This ontology (Language Representation) defines the model for the standard, based in part on ISO 639-4, with individual codes for the other parts of the standard represented in dependent models.</sm:fileAbstract>

This includes generalizing the ontology to accommodate country and region coding systems in addition to the ISO 3166 codes, providing some flexibility to use this ontology as the schema to support integration and use of other systems.  Such coding systems might include governmental and corporate distinctions from the codes published by the U.N. and standardized by ISO, or reflect domain-specific codes such as the International Olympic Committee, International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), or other international or national sporting organizations. The structure of the ontologies representing the codes themselves has been revised to support an ontology per country for the subdivision codes, so that users can leverage only those they need rather than having to load close to five thousand individuals for applications requiring a small subset of that number. Generation of the country and subdivision ontologies is entirely automated to facilitate change management going forward.</skos:changeNote>

        <skos:changeNote rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The ontology was revised in August 2014 to:
(1) clean up the metadata about this ontology to reflect current usage
(2) add support for OMG issue resolution detail to facilitate change management and automated specification generation
(3) modify the approach to inclusion of licensing information in model metadata to reference an individual of type dct:LicenseDocument, contained in this metadata ontology, rather than requiring the text to be repeated in any ontology published by the OMG</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The ontology was revised in July, 2013, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing and specifically for the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) and other forthcoming OMG ontology specifications  
   (2) to introduce the use of version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to extend the file-level metadata to allow for cases such as FIBO, where the specification includes family, specification, spcification version, module, and ontology level detail that should be documented via annotations (e.g., family level of FIBO, specification level of Foundations, module level such as Utilities, and ontology level including annotation vocabulary, business types, and relations) 
   (5) to make other minor corrections in the metadata and definitions for clarification purposes</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification. It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

	* FinancialDates -- financial Dates and Schedules
	* BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
	* Occurrences -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them. Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the June 2014 Boston meeting in support of the IND RFC.</skos:changeNote>
        <skos:editorialNote>(1) The present version of the ontology covers the English sections of the ISO 4217 standard only, and (2) UTF-8 character encodings are employed in names in the currency codes ontology to support the broadest number of tools.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:historyNote rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Revisions are managed per the process outlined in the Policies and Procedures for OMG standards, with the intent to maintain backwards compatibility to the degree possible.
  
The RDF/XML serialized OWL corresponding to the ODM/OWL model has been checked for syntactic errors and logical consistency with Protege 4 (http://protege.stanford.edu/), HermiT 1.3.8 (http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) and Pellet 2.2 (http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/).</skos:historyNote>
        <skos:historyNote rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This ontology is ultimately intended to represent all of ISO 639 for reference purposes, and to be sufficiently extensible to accommodate new sections or modifications as they are published. The current version of the ontology (including subordinate modules containing the language names and codes) provides a unique English name (i.e., the reference name from 639-3) for each language, with UTF-8 encoded literals specifying alternates in English, French, and Indigenous languages where present in the standard, and in German corresponding to the names on the LoC web site.

1.  Where multiple English names occur in 639-1 and 639-2, we have used the primary name specified in 639-2:1998 superseded by the latest revision posted by the registration authority, or, where multiples are specified by the registration authority, the reference name from ISO 639-3 as the &apos;named individual name&apos; for a given language. For languages specified in ISO 639-1, there is at least one English name and at least one French name for every language, corresponding to exactly one alpha-2 code.  Most languages from ISO 639-1 have at least one indigenous name.  Most languages with codes available from the Library of Congress also have at least one German name.  The correspondence between the alpha-2 codes and languages are made explicit in the individuals representing the codes themselves, and can be inferred for the languages using an OWL DL reasoner.

2.  This release of the ontology covers all languages specified in parts 1 and 2 of the standard, and categorizes the alpha-3 codes from part 2 according to the categorization scheme provided in parts 3 and 4.  Subsequent releases of the ontology will address additional languages covered in part 3, as well as additional components of the standard, such as equivalence to standards representing relevant scripts, as they become available, and the language groups covered by ISO 639-5.

3.  We have used individuals to represent all alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, which, in turn, have matching strings (tags) associated with them for use in a variety of applications to facilitate reasoning and mapping.  The strings are provided as datatype properties of the individuals to support applications that may require them for RFC 4646-style tagging.
  
4.  Note that some tools, including certain UML tools, are case insensitive.  Thus, in cases where a language name collides with an alpha-2 or alpha-3 code, (i.e., Ga, Ewe, Fon, Ido, Lao, Tiv, Twi, Vai, and Yao), the names for the individual codes have been extended with &apos;_1&apos; (e.g., &apos;ewe_1&apos;).

5.  We found a few anomalies in the standards while developing this ontology.  These include: 
(1) Bihari is included in the 2002 version of 639-1, in the 1998 version of 639-2, and in the online codes posted by the Library of Congress in 2007 for parts 1 and 2, with part 1 code of &apos;bh&apos; and part 2 bibliographic and terminology codes of &apos;bih&apos;.  At that time, there was no discussion stating that Bihari is a collective language, although it was omitted from the downloadable data for 639-3.  Since then, the language element has been renamed &apos;Bihari languages&apos;, in both English and French, without change to the corresponding language codes.  The latest version of the code sets reflect this modification.  Our assumption is that the trigraph for Bihari is a collective language code, which is supported by online research in Eastern Indic languages.
(2) Serbo-Croatian was included in the 2002 version of 639-1, with part 1 code &apos;sh&apos;.  It was not mentioned in the 1998 version of 693-2, but appears in 639-3 with a language identifier of &apos;hbs&apos;, without codes for 639-2.  As of 2010, Serbo-Croation has been eliminated from ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes altogether, and the ontology reflects this.
(3) Other changes in the latest version of the ontology include elimination of the 639-1 code for Moldavian, merging the language with Romanian, and additional English and French names for some languages, such as Dutch (to include Flemish, flamais), among others.

        <skos:editorialNote>The domain for this property should be interpreted as being an abstraction which covers various forms of commitment, which may set out the existence of some notional amount of money, specified via this property. This is left unspecified for now, so that the property can also be defined directly as being a property of some contractual term which describes that commitment.</skos:editorialNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>The notional amount (or notional principal amount or notional value) on a financial instrument is the nominal or face amount that is used to calculate payments made on that instrument. This amount generally does not change and is thus referred to as notional.
		
		For securities the nominal value is often referred to as the face or par value. This is the redemption price of the security and is normally stated on the front of that security. With respect to bonds and stocks, it is the stated value of an issued security, as opposed to its market value.
		
		When applied to a swap this is the amount used for calculating the actual value of the interest due. Also known as Notional Value when describing derivative contracts in the options, futures, and currency markets, this term is often used to value the underlying asset in a derivatives trade. It can be the total value of a position, how much value a position controls, or an agreed-upon amount in a contract.

		An example is that a firm might have a variable rate loan on $100,000 but decide to swap only $40,000. The $40,000 is the notional amount of the swap and becomes the amount on which interest is paid.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>indicates the principal place where an entity conducts business, such as where its headquarters is located</skos:definition>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Corporate domicile refers to a place where a company&apos;s affairs are discharged. It is also typically the legal home of a corporation because the place is considered by law as the center of corporate affairs. In cases where a business has incorporated in one location for convenience, such as for taxation, legal, or regulatory purposes, but operates primarily in one or more other locations, domicile in FIBO refers to the operational location(s) rather than legal location. Many companies in the US have incorporated in the State of Delaware, for example, but do not have operational facilities in Delaware (or only have small offices there).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>For British or Commonwealth companies, a privately held company limited by shares is a type of company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, certain Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland. It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the company&apos;s insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private. Private companies limited by shares are required to have the suffix Limited (often written Ltd or Ltd.) or Incorporated (Inc.) as part of their name, though the latter cannot be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Teoranta (Teo.) may be used instead, largely by Gaeltacht companies. Cyfyngedig (Cyf.) may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

The third (right-most) character of the identifier (alphabetic code) is an indicator derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund. If the currency is not associated with a single geographical entity as described in ISO 3166-1, typically a specially allocated identifier (alpha-2 code) is used to describe the currency authority. This code has been allocated by the Maintenance Agency from within the user-assigned range of codes XA to XZ specified in 8.1.3 of ISO 3166-1:2013. The character following X will be a mnemonic, where possible, derived from the name of the geographical area concerned.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>something autonomous that can adapt to and interact with its environment</skos:definition>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on. While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems. The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.

Whether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:

(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention. Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography. When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.

(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment. These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification. They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature. The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.

(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately. Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences. They can learn and evolve.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>Note that this does not necessarily imply that an agent is free to act as it sees fit, without constraint. Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>The use of custom datatypes is outside the OWL 2 RL profile and so users should consider commenting out the restriction on hasTextValue altogether or change the data range to rdfs:Literal in applications that are constrained to OWL 2 RL.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>

        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>If issued in the form of a small, mostly standard-sized card, it is usually called an identity card (IC). Countries which do not have formal identity documents may require informal documents. In the absence of a formal identity document, driving licenses can be used in many countries as a method of proof of identity, although some countries do not accept driving licenses for identification, often because in those countries they don&apos;t expire as documents and can be old and easily forged. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification. Most countries have the rule that foreign citizens need to have their passport or occasionally a national identity card from their country available at any time if they do not have residence permit in the country.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A national identification number, national identity number, or national insurance number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions. The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.

The ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.

Many countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <skos:definition>schedule whose time intervals recur regularly</skos:definition>
        <skos:editorialNote>The BusinessDates ontology extends &apos;RegularSchedule&apos; with an optional BusinessDayAdjustment that specifies what should happen if a scheduled date falls on a weekend or a holiday.</skos:editorialNote>
        <skos:example>A 30 year mortgage is payable monthly on the 10th of the month, starting July 2015. The mortgage is issued on June 15, 2015 so the first payment is for the period June 15-June 30, and the last payment is for June 1-14 2045.

The payment schedule is a RegularSchedule with these properties:

* comprises: regular payment OccurrenceKind (with payment details) (see the &apos;comprises&apos; property of the Occurrences ontology)
* hasInitialStub: June 15-30, 2015 for initial payment
* hasFinalStub: June 1-14, 2045 for final payment
* hasCount: 358
* hasOverallPeriod starting Date: June 15, 2015 with a duration of 30 years
* hasRecurrenceInterval: specifies 10th day of each calendar month
* hasRecurrenceStartDate: July 1, 2015</skos:example>
        <skos:example>A corporate bond pays interest for 10 years starting on the first day of 2015. Interest payments are due 15 days after the expiration of each 6 month period: on July 15 and January 16.

The payment schedule is a RegularSchedule, with these properties:

* comprises: identifies the interest payment details
* overall DatePeriod starting date is &apos;2015-01-01&apos;, ending date is &apos;2025-01-15&apos;, and duration is &apos;P10Y15D&apos;
* hasCount is 20 (2 payments per year for 10 years)
* hasRecurrenceInterval is &apos;P6M&apos;
* hasRecurrenceStartDate is &apos;2015-01-15&apos;</skos:example>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>A RegularSchedule is a Schedule defined as a set of Dates that start on a recurrence start date and repeat after each recurrence interval. The size of this set is defined by a count.

The &apos;initial ScheduleStub&apos; associated with a RegularSchedule identifies any special treatment applied before the recurrence start date. Similarly, a &apos;final ScheduleStub&apos; identifies any special handling at the end of the recurrences. For example, a mortgage loan that is due each calendar month may have an initial payment due before the first calendar month, or a final payment due after the last monthly payment.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>Other ontologies can extend RegularSchedule as needed.

In particular, the Occurrences ontology extends RegularSchedule to &apos;comprise&apos; an &apos;OccurrenceKind&apos;. The intended meaning is that a regular schedule comprises a number of scheduled dates and an event which is scheduled to occur on each of those dates, in other words an Occurrence of the OccurrenceKind should happen on each Date defined by the RegularSchedule.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>
        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>The recurrence start date can be an ExplicitDate or any kind of CalculatedDate. Hence, the starting date could be relative to another Date (e.g. T+3) or triggered by the Occurrence of an OccurrenceKind, etc.

The recurrence start date can also be relative to the starting Date of the overall DatePeriod of the Schedule.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:usageNote>

        <skos:scopeNote>This definition does not include workers in contingent arrangements, such as independent contractors, leased employees, temporary employees, on-call workers, and others that do not have a direct contractual relationship with the employer.

        <fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>In the broadest sense, employment is the situation in which someone is fully engaged in doing something that they want to do. From a FIBO perspective, however, employment is understood to be more specific. It is the relationship between two parties, evidenced by an implicit or explicit contract, in which work is compensated and in which one party, a legal person, typically a formal organization, acts as the employer and the other, typically a legally capable natural person, as the employee.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

        <rdfs:label>party in role</rdfs:label>
        <skos:definition>relative concept that ties a person or organization to a specific role they stand in</skos:definition>
        <skos:example>Examples include organization member, issuer, owner, partner in a partnership, shareholder, etc.</skos:example>
        <skos:scopeNote>The concept of a party in a role refers only to those contexts in which in natural English one would call someone a &apos;party&apos; for example being party to a contract or to a transaction; it does not cover entities as performing some role in some activity or process (the separate concept Actor covers that). A good test is whether the relative thing defined as PartyInRole can be sensibly said to have a part or play a part in something. Corresponds to the English (not data modeling) sense of the word &apos;Party&apos;.</skos:scopeNote>

- only one populated place such as a city, town, or village
- several of such places (e.g., early jurisdictions in the state of New Jersey (1798-1899) as townships governing several villages, Municipalities of Mexico)
- only parts of such places, sometimes boroughs of a city such as the 34 municipalities of Santiago, Chile.</skos:scopeNote>

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single &apos;figure of merit&apos; for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful &apos;average&apos; to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5).</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
